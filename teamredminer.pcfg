#   -h, --help                Display this help message and exit.
#       --debug               Enables debug log output.
#       --disable_colors      Disables console output colors.
#       --force_colors        Forces console color output even if the terminal does not seem to support them.
#       --api_listen=IP:PORT  Enables the api. IP:PORT is optional. If present, the IP:PORT combo decides
#                               the interface(s) and port to listen to. Default is 127.0.0.1:4028. For
#                               external access, use e.g. 0.0.0.0:4028. It's also valid to only specify the
#                               port, e.g. 4029.
#       --log_file=FILENAME   Enables logging of miner output into the file specified by FILENAME.
#   -l, --log_interval=SEC    Set the time interval in seconds for averaging and printing GPU hashrates.
#                               SEC sets the interval in seconds, and must be > 0.
# 
# Pool config options:
#   -o, --url=URL             Sets the pool URL.  Currently stratum+tcp and stratum+ssl URLs are supported.
#                               Each additional time this option is specified will start a new pool config.
#                               Per-pool options (such as -u, -p) will need to be explicitly specified
#                               again for each new pool.  (See the example start_multipool.sh/bat file)
#                               The multi-pool strategy for the miner is set with the --pool_strategy option.
#   -u, --user=USERNAME       Sets the username for pool authorization.
#   -p, --pass=PASSWORD       Sets the password for pool authorization.
#       --pool_force_ensub    Forces an extranonce subscribe request for supported pools unknown to the miner.
#       --pool_no_ensub       Prevent miner from sending extranonce subscribe request to the pool.
#       --pool_broken_rpc     Tells the miner to only allow a single outstanding rpc request on the pool
#                               connection.  This is a work-around for pools that violate the json rpc
#                               specification regarding rpc IDs.
# 
# Global pool options:
#       --pool_connect_TO=SEC Set the time-out for attempting to connect to a pool. SEC is the time to wait in
#                               seconds. Default is 10.
#       --pool_rpc_TO=SEC     Set how long the miner will wait for an unanswered RPC to the pool.  After this
#                               time, the miner will reconnect to the pool.  SEC is the time to wait in seconds.
#                               Default is 60.
#       --pool_max_rejects=N  If a pool rejects N shares in a row, the pool connection is reset. This is to prevent
#                               against pools that invalidates mining sessions without disconnecting the user.
#                               Default value is 5.
#       --pool_strategy=STRAT Sets the strategy for selecting pools when running with multiple pools.  The available
#                               values are: priority, load_balance, and quota.  The default is priority. 
#                               priority: The miner will use pools in the order they are listed, only moving on 
#                                 to the next pool if the previous cannot establish a connection. 
#                               load_balance: The miner will evenly balance the hashrate across all currently
#                                 connected pools.
#                               quota: The miner will evenly balance the total hashes completed across 
#                                 all pools.  If a pool disconnects and later reconnects, the miner will move 
#                                 hashrate to the pool until the total hashes for each pool is balanced. 
#       --no_ntime_roll       Prevents the miner from rolling ntime in the block header, only using the value
#                               provided by the pool. This needs to be enabled for some pools when mining x16rt.
# 
# GPU options:
#       --platform=INDEX      Sets the index of the OpenCL platform to use. If not specified, platform will
#                               be auto-detected. Linux with multiple platforms is only supported using no
#                               --platform arg but instead adding --bus_reorder.
#   -d, --devices=DEVLIST     Sets gpu devices to use from detected list. DEVLIST should be a comma-
#                               separated list of device indices, e.g. -d 0,1,2,4.  If not specified, all
#                               devices on the platform(s) will be used.  NOTE: by default the devices are ordered
#                               by pcie bus ordering. Use --list_devices to show indices.
#       --init_style=1/2/3    Specified the init style (1 is default):
#                               1: One gpu at the time, complete all before mining.
#                               2: Three gpus at the time, complete all before mining.
#                               3: All gpus in parallel, start mining immediately.
#       --pcie_fmt=FORMAT     Sets print format for pcie bus numbers.  The accepted values for FORMAT are
#                               either 'hex' or 'dec'.  The default is dec for windows and hex for linux.
#       --bus_reorder         Reorders the detected or specified devices after their pcie bus id.  If no
#                               platform is specified, devices will be collected from all detected AMD OpenCL
#                               platforms.  Note: As of version v0.7.0 this is the default behavior.
#       --opencl_order        Orders the detected or specified devices in the order OpenCL presents them.
#       --list_devices        Lists the available devices for the detected or specified platform and exits
#                               immediately.  Bus reordering will be implemented in the displayed order.
# 
# Watchdog options:
#       --no_gpu_monitor      Disables the ADL (Windows) or sysfs (Linux) GPU monitor for temperature and
#                               fan speed.
#       --temp_limit=TEMP     Sets the temperature at which the miner will stop GPUs that are too hot.
#                               Default is 85C.
#       --temp_resume=TEMP    Sets the temperature below which the miner will resume GPUs that were previously
#                               stopped due to temperature exceeding limit.  Default is 60C.
#       --watchdog_script(=X) Configures the gpu watchdog to shut down the miner and run the specified platform
#                               and exits immediately. The default script is watchdog.bat/watchdog.sh in the
#                               current directory, but a different script can be provided as an optional argument,
#                               potentially with a absolute or relative path as well.
#       --watchdog_test       Tests the configured watchdog script by triggering the same action as a dead gpu
#                               after ~20 secs of mining.
#       --watchdog_disabled   Forces the watchdog to not execute. Can be used to disable the watchdog in mining os
#                               that always run with the watchdog enabled.
# 
# Ethash options:
#       --eth_config=CONFIG   Manual ethash configuration for the miner.  CONFIG must be in the form [M][L].
#                               The [M] value selects the mode which can be either 'A' or 'B'.
#                               The 'B' mode uses additional memory and will only work on 8+GB cards.
#                               The [L] value selects the intensity and it's range will depend on the GPU architecture.
#                               Both values are optional, but if [L] is specified, [M] must also be specified.
#                               Example configs: --eth_config=A
#                                                --eth_config=B750
#                               CONFIG can also be a comma separated list of config values where each is
#                               applied to each GPU. For example: --eth_config=A,B750,,A288
#                               Any gpu that does not have a specific config in the list will use the first
#                               config in the list.
#       --eth_aggr_mode       Enables automatic use of the 'B' mode for all Polaris 8GB cards, unless they have a
#                               different config provided by the --eth_config argument.  This is the same thing as 
#                               manually setting all Polaris 8GB gpus in the rig to 'B' mode using --eth_config.
#                               For most gpus, this adds 0.1-0.2 MH/s of hashrate.  NOTE: 20-25% of rigs becomes less
#                               stable in this mode which is the reason it isn't the default mode.  If you experience
#                               dead gpus, you should remove this argument and run the gpus in the 'A' mode.  Moreover,
#                               this option will stop working when the DAG approaches 4GB. 
#       --eth_stratum_mode=MODE Sets a fixed stratum mode for ethash pools.  By default the miner will attempt
#                               to automatically determine the type of stratum the pool supports and use that mode.
#                               This automatic detection can be overriden by specifying this option.  The MODE can be
#                               set to one of the following options: stratum, nicehash, ethproxy. 
#       --eth_worker          Set the worker id that will be sent to pool.  This only applies to pools with ethproxy
#                               stratum mode.
#       --eth_epoch           Tests a specific ethash epoch. NOTE: you still need to provide a pool as if you were mining,
#                               but no shares will be submitted. Simulated mining only.
# 
# Progpow options:
#       --prog_config=CONFIG  Manual progpow configuration for the miner.  CONFIG must be in the form [M][L].
#                               The [M] value selects the mode which can be either 'A' or 'B'.
#                               The 'B' mode typically results in better performance but is only available for
#                               Vega on linux and Navi (linux or windows).
#                               The [L] value selects the intensity and it's range will depend on the GPU architecture.
#                               Both values are optional, but if [L] is specified, [M] must also be specified.
#                               Example configs: --prog_config=A
#                                                --prog_config=B750
#                               CONFIG can also be a comma separated list of config values where each is
#                               applied to each GPU. For example: --prog_config=A,B750,,A288
#                               Any gpu that does not have a specific config in the list will use the first.
#       --prog_height=VALUE   Sets a fixed block height for progpow algorithms for benchmarking purposes.
#                               Note that using this option needs a pool connection but will not submit shares.
#       --prog_strict         Forces miner to always generate strictly accurate kernels.  By default the miner will
#                               generate relaxed kernels that use less computation power but can result in 
#                               occasional invalid shares.
# 
# Cryptonight options:
#       --rig_id              Set the rig identifier that will be sent to the pool. This is only used for
#                               cryptonight pools.
#       --cn_config=CONFIG    Manual cryptonight configuration for the miner.  CONFIG must be in the form
#                               [P][I0][M][I1][:xyz], where [P] is an optional prefix and [:xyz] is an
#                               optional suffix.  For [P], only the value of 'L' is supported for low-end
#                               GPUs like Lexa/Baffin.  [I0] and [I1] are the thread intensity values normally
#                               ranging from 1 to 16, but larger values are possible for 16GB gpus.  [M] is the
#                               mode which can be either '.', -', '+' or '*'.  Mode '.' means that the miner
#                               should choose or scan for the best mode.  Mode '*' both a good default more and
#                               _should_ be used if you mine on a Vega 56/64 with modded mem timings.  The
#                               exceptions to this rule are small pad variants (cnv8_trtl and cnv8_upx2), they
#                               should still use '+'. For Polaris gpus, only the '-' and '+' modes are available.
#                               
#                               NOTE: in TRM 0.5.0 auto-tuning functionality was added, making manual configuration
#                               of the CN config modes unnecessary except for rare corner cases.  For more info, 
#                               see the tuning docs and how-to documents bundled with the release. 
#                               
#                               Example configs: --cn_config=15*15:AAA
#                                                --cn_config=14-14
#                                                --cn_config=L4+3

#                               applied to each GPU. For example: --cn_config=8-8,16+14:CBB,15*15,14-14
#                               Any gpu that does not have a specific config in the list will use the first
#                               config in the list.
#       --no_cpu_check        Disables cpu verification of found shares before they are submitted to the pool.
#                               Note: only CN algos currently supports cpu verification.
#       --no_lean             Disables the CN lean mode where ramp up threads slowly on start or restart after
#                               network issues or gpu temp throttling. 
#       --no_interleave=DEVS  Lists gpu devices where CN thread interleave logic should be not be used. 
#                               The argument is a comma-separated list of devices like for the -d option. 
#                               Use this argument if some device(s) get a worse hashrate together with a lot
#                               of interleave adjust log messages. 
#       --alloc_patch=DEVS    Lists gpu devices that loses hashrate between TRM v0.4.5 and later versions. With this 
#                               argument a simpler mem allocation strategy is used, and the old (higher) hashrate should
#                               be restored. Auto-tuning mode can still be used.
#       --auto_tune=MODE      Enable the auto-tune mode upon startup. Only available for CN variants. MODE must 
#                               be either NONE, QUICK or SCAN. The QUICK mode checks a few known good configurations
#                               and completes within 1 min. The SCAN mode will check all possible combos and will
#                               run for 20-30 mins. Setting MODE to NONE disable the auto-tune feature. The default
#                               mode is QUICK. 
#       --auto_tune_runs(=N)  Executes multiple runs for the auto tune, each time decreasing the unit of pads used -1
#                               in one of the threads (15+15 -> 15+14 -> 14+14 -> 14+13 -> ...). You can specify the
#                               explicit nr of runs or let the miner choose a default value per gpu type (typically 3-4).
#       --auto_tune_exit      If present, the miner will exit after completing the auto-tuning process. This is helpful
#                               when you want to scan for optimal settings and then use the resulting command line arg
#                               printed by the miner.
#       --allow_large_alloc   If present, and when the driver indicates there is enough GPU vram available, the miner
#                               will be more aggressive with the initial memory allocation. In practice, this option
#                               means that Vega GPUs under Linux will start the auto-tuning process at 16*15 rather
#                               than 16*14 or 15*15.
# 
# MTP options:
#       --allow_all_devices   Some algos can't be mined on e.g. 4GB gpus. Those gpus will be disabled automatically
#                               by the miner. This argument overrides this logic and allows mining on all specified
#                               or detected devices.
# 
# X16* options:
#       --hash_order=VALUE    Sets a fixed hash order for algorithms like x16r for benchmarking purposes.
#                               Note that using this option needs a pool connection but will not submit shares.
#                               The standard benchmark hash order for x16r is --hash_order=0123456789abcdef.
# Nimiq options:
#       --nimiq_worker=VALUE  Sets the worker/device name for nimiq to pass to the pool(s).
#       --nimiq_no_proxy      Disables the automatic Nimiq proxy executed as a separate process. This means that the
#                               host and port passed to the miner must be pointing to a proxy.
#       --nimiq_proxy=VALUE   Overrides the default path to the Nimiq proxy. The default is trm_nimiq_proxy-win.exe.
#                               and trm_nimiq_proxy-linux in the current miner director.
#       --nimiq_port=VALUE    Overrides the default local port (4444) used for the Nimiq proxy. This can be used if your
#                               system is already using port 4444 for some other tcp/ip service.
